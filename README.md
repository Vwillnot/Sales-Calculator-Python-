I have written a program that takes quarterly sales from an organization and calculates the total sales. The output changes according to sales entered. I used try/except blocks along with an indicator to determine whether sales are high, medium, or low. High sales are $140,000 or greater, medium sales are less than $140,000 and more $40,000, and low sales are less than $40,000. This program only accepts numeric integer inputs an error will be issued if none integers are input.
